Take a look at the latest news in funding, startup milestones, and emerging trends tied to the region’s innovation potential.

M&As of CEE-rooted companies

Sustainability software company Plan A , with a Bulgarian founder at its helm, has been acquired by Diginex (NASDAQ: DGNX) in an $80 million cash-and-equity transaction, bringing together Plan A’s decarbonisation and ESG capabilities with Diginex’s RegTech and supply-chain expertise. Founder and CEO will remain in her role to lead the combined growth strategy.

Founded in 2017 by Lubomila Jordanova, Plan A was built around a clear mission to help businesses measure and manage their environmental footprint, a value proposition that gained strong traction during the peak of the ESG wave as companies rushed to comply with growing regulatory and investor demands.

Museum of Illusions , the world’s largest privately owned museum chain, has been acquired from Invera Capital Partners (based in Zagreb, Croatia), by an investor group led by Brightwood Capital Advisors , with Constitution Capital Partners serving as lead co-investor.

Founded in 2015, the brand has expanded rapidly to nearly 70 locations across 27 countries and plans to use the investment to accelerate its global growth.

Across Europe and the world

CES 2026 , the annual consumer tech conference held in Las Vegas, took place this week, bringing together the biggest names and boldest ideas in technology. AI dominated the spotlight, from major announcements by Nvidia and AMD to Amazon and Google pushing AI deeper into the physical world.

Several CEE countries, including Romania, Ukraine, and Poland, were represented at CES 2026, showcasing companies such as Romania’s AROBS Transilvania Software and Dotlumen , Ukraine’s DOZOR AI and Lanka Robotics, and Poland’s CTHINGS.CO on the global stage.

OpenAI has started the year with another acqui-hire , bringing on the founding team of Convogo, a platform focused on automating leadership assessments and feedback for coaches, consultants, and HR teams. The deal, described as an all-stock transaction, does not include Convogo’s technology or IP, with co-founders Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett joining OpenAI to work on its AI cloud initiatives.",2418,Plan A,Lubomila Jordanova,$80 million,CES 2026,Invera Capital Partners | Brightwood Capital Advisors | Constitution Capital Partners,high

This shift was marked in Bucharest in Novemeber 2025, with the launch of Cleantech for SEE , by Clean European Futures, a platform aiming to bridge the gap between the region’s high-growth potential and the persistent “geography penalty” that many of its founders still face. This platform is part of larger movement: Cleantech for CEE , aiming to created a bridge between the innovation ecosystem between the Czech Republic all the way down to Cyprus. Cleantech for CEE was launched earlier in March 2025 in Warsaw by Suzana Carp in collaboration with Start Smart CEE, a foundation for technology entrepreneurship headquartered in Poland.

The SouthEast European chapter is the last puzzle piece in this wider construction that comes to fill this geographical gap by aiming to consolidate the ecosystems between the Danube, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.

What happens in the EU countries from SouthEast Europe and how they leverage the Clean Industrial Deal is particularly important to the enlargement context, points Suzana Carp , CEO of Clean European Futures and Co-Founder of Cleantech for CEE & SEE . By building a strong tech and green energy network in Southeast Europe, the EU is showing neighbor countries that joining the union is the best way to turn their local startups into global competitors. With Cyprus leading the EU next, this mission to grow and innovate is now a top priority, she believes.

The high-growth paradox

The CEE ecosystem is currently a study in contradictions . While the region’s enterprise value has grown significantly faster over the last decade than more mature European markets, it remains chronically underserved by the very EU funding instruments designed to spark innovation. “ For Europe to jump ahead in the global competitiveness race, it must change the strategy it has had so far ,” says Carp .

The numbers back this up. Despite the pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions, SEE’s specialization in software-led cleantech and circular economy platforms allowed many of its startups to scale rapidly, partly because they were less vulnerable to the physical disruptions that hit hardware-heavy sectors, Carp explains.

“In fact, the general entreprise value growth of the SEE European region is many times higher than that of other European regions , because when companies have grown here, they have grown faster than in other places. Additionally, the region has seen a faster development of cleantech skills than other regions, with several innovators developing schools of skills (on heat pumps or wind for example). This model will surely be copied by the rest of Europe.”

The “bankability” barrier

However, the path from validation to market readiness is still paved with friction. High-profile EU instruments , such as the Innovation Fund and European Investment Bank (EIB) loans, often come with maturity requirements that don’t align with the ground reality in SEE.

Carp notes that these instruments underperformed in the region for years because they treat regional innovators with “ maturity requirements that don’t match the reality on the ground, especially around issues related to bankability .” Romania, for instance, only accessed its first Innovation Fund project four years after the instrument’s inception , despite its heavy industrial base and active ecosystem.

“It is important that this is fixed by making these instruments more suitable for innovators before the next EU budget is agreed. Cleantech financing through the EIB will increase, and we must ensure we know how to access it in the region with the highest potential for fast growth and upskilling.”

Slovenian startup ReCatalyst is a textbook example of what deep-tech in Central/Eastern Europe can achieve when European programs and smart private capital align, but also a warning about invisible barriers that remain . Without ERC, EIT, and EIC support, their technology would have stayed in academic journals, deprived of the much wider real-world impact, Matija Gatalo , CEO of ReCatalyst notes, “but our journey also shows the other side of the story”…

“In CEE/SEE, geography still quietly shapes access to capital. We had to secure domestic investors just to unlock our otherwise oversubscribed Seed round, and we were once told that if we were based in Germany or Switzerland, we would have been funded long before. Initiatives like Cleantech for SEE matter because they build the bridges that founders in this region still have to construct on their own.”

A Theory of Change

Carp identifies “ ecosystem consolidation ” as the first hurdle to be cleared. While infrastructure issues like rail and electricity interconnections are long-term projects tied to the Connecting Europe Facility , building a unified voice for regional innovators is a change that can happen now.

“ We need to develop a theory of change for the region which then creates a systemic shift ,” Carp explains. She believes the upcoming Clean Industrial Deal will finally force the EU to address its previous “blindspots”, specifically the massive potential of SEE to leverage its own competitive advantages: abundant clean energy, a highly skilled workforce, and cost-competitiveness on land.

Notable funding shifts for 2026

To address these regional disparities, the European Innovation Council (EIC) has announced several strategic updates for its 2026 Work Programme aimed at easing the path for cleantech innovators :

EIC Advanced Innovation Challenges: A new instrument designed to bridge the gap between early validation and market readiness .

Two-Stage Scheme: Single applicants or small consortia can apply for an initial €300,000 grant for solution validation (TRL 4), followed by larger grants up to €2.5 million to reach market readiness (TRL 6–7) .

Process Flexibility: The EIC Accelerator is moving toward more submission points, shorter templates, and a stronger role for technical experts who will assess projects earlier in the process .

Thematic Focus: Specific challenges will prioritize advanced materials for energy storage, deep-tech for climate adaptation, soil regeneration biotech, and critical raw-material value chains .",6387,Cleantech for SEE,Suzana Carp,NA,NA,NA,low

For years, participants in this sector have complained that financial regulation hasn’t kept pace with the pace of technological innovation . But in 2025 — and in 2026, regulation is picking up the pace. So now it is on fintechs to make sure they’re the ones keeping up.

Personally, I see a clear pattern emerging: watchdogs want more visibility, more data, and more direct control over how digital finance operates. And while this may sound intimidating to some, it can also become a competitive edge for firms that adapt early.

So, what’s actually changing? Which regulatory priorities will affect the EU landscape for fintechs the most in 2026 and beyond it? Let us work it out.

Supervision is moving towards centralization

If we look toward the EU, we can see that for years, this region’s model landscape was shaped by national regulators interpreting the same rules in slightly different ways . Now, however, that era is coming to an end, giving way to a demand for greater clarity.

ESMA is undergoing a major MiFID II/MiFIR review aimed at tightening market structure rules, so as to make trading in Europe less fragmented, easier to understand, and harder to manipulate. In October 2025, the watchdog issued a public statement that outlines revised transparency rules, showing that the review on the whole explicitly targets how transparent and open markets must be.

In broader terms, ESMA is looking at how markets are organized, how prices are formed, and how information is shared with investors. For fintechs, this means more detailed reporting, stricter data standards, and fewer grey areas in how trading services must operate.

At the same time, since around mid-2025, the regulator has been collecting feedback specifically focused on the customer journey . Whether any regulatory or non-regulatory barriers may be discouraging participation, how requirements operate in practice and shape investor experiences, and if any particular adjustments might help simplify things.

To me, this shows that the regulator is looking beyond just technical compliance and instead examining how people actually move through the entire investing process. It’s a strong sign that the next wave of rules will focus more on onboarding flows, disclosure formats, and how firms shape investor decision-making . Fintechs should anticipate tighter expectations for how their products are structured, explained, and distributed.

Finally, there is a strong push from the European Commission to give ESMA more direct control over exchanges, crypto firms, and clearing houses, instead of leaving most supervision in the hands of national regulators. The reason for this is simple: today, the same set of rules can be interpreted differently, depending on which EU member state they were dealing with. This tends to create a lot of confusion, slowing down cross-border business operations.

Should oversight become centralized under ESMA — and there’s a good chance that it will — those inconsistencies can be dealt away with. For fintech firms that operate across borders, it will also mean cleaning up their own internal processes and systems. Instead of using different reporting standards for different regions, they’ll need one consistent data setup that can report accurately to both ESMA and regulators in other countries. Companies that build with this unified structure in mind early on will find it much easier to scale across markets faster and avoid unexpected compliance issues later on.

Crypto is being absorbed into mainstream financial regulation

For a long time, the crypto markets have been something that regulators tried to move around, as they were too niche to really accommodate. Now, they are far from niche, and so the days of “light touch” are over.

Since the introduction of MiCA , Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) in the EU are required to meet most of the same expectations as traditional financial institutions: capital requirements, governance, local presence, and formal authorization.

The transition period runs into mid-2026, but the expectations are already clear. ESMA has even warned firms not to “badge-wash” — as in, not to use their “MiCA-compliant” status to market unregulated products alongside regulated ones

And even if we look beyond the EU, there are also examples of other regulators taking a highly structured approach to regulating this market. In Dubai, for example, the DFSA has established its Crypto Token regime all the way back in 2022, and has been gradually updating it ever since.

The regime sets strict rules on governance, custody, disclosure and market abuse. It also recognizes only a curated list of tokens (around 80% of the global crypto market cap), and it can revoke recognition, instantly changing which assets a firm can legally support.

In other words, crypto infrastructure today increasingly needs to look and behave like FX or equities infrastructure. Same levels of surveillance, risk modelling, best execution, and reporting practices must be consistently applied. Firms that stop looking at crypto as a “special snowflake” and view it instead as just another instrument in their multi-asset stack will have an easier time in this regard.

Operational resilience is the name of the game now

Operational resilience used to be a topic that everyone agreed was important, but rarely invested in properly. That changed with the EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) , which became fully enforceable in January 2025. DORA mandates strong ICT risk management, third-party oversight, incident reporting, and regular resilience testing. And for the first time, regulators can directly supervise “critical” tech providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Bloomberg and LSEG — 19 major tech firms have been designated as such so far.

The DFSA in Dubai has taken a similar direction: its thematic review of Money Services Providers in 2024 emphasized operational frameworks and Strong Customer Authentication, and the authority already had long-standing and detailed outsourcing rules.

In simple terms: regulators now care exactly who runs your cloud, payment hubs, and connectivity providers — and how you will operate if they fail.

From the point of view of fintech firms, this means that “DIY infrastructure” will become a liability . Institutional clients will naturally prefer partners that already offer multi-region setups, full vendor-risk mapping, audit trails, and DORA-style incident reporting by default. Operational resilience will shift from a behind-the-scenes IT concern to a core part of commercial strategy.

The bottom line: 2026 will reward the ones who prepare

To put the long story short, regulation is becoming more coordinated, more data-driven, and more demanding across the board . And while it may appear intimidating, this is not at all a bad thing. In fact, clearer rules are exactly what mature financial ecosystems need, because they create clearer paths for growth.

The rules are changing quickly, yes. But with the right strategy, they can become a source of competitive advantage rather than a barrier. The firms that thrive in 2026 will be the ones that recognize these shifts early and build their internal processes accordingly.",7412,fintechs,NA,NA,NA,investors,medium

In one community, I saw founders discussing paying 3–5% of equity or €10,000–30,000 upfront to consultants to raise capital on their behalf . What alarmed me most in this situation was that it wasn’t treated as a mistake by other founders. It was being normalized.

Why CEE founders are outsourcing fundraising

The startup ecosystem in Central and Eastern Europe is still in its early stages of development. One of the core challenges is a lack of transparent, shared information, especially regarding fundraising . In Western Europe and the US, there are stronger networks and peer communities that help founders learn from one another and gain a deeper understanding of the process. There, the core principle is clear — fundraising is the founder’s job.

But in CEE, it’s not uncommon to meet technical founders who want to outsource that responsibility. Some turn to consultants or fundraising advisors, thinking, “ They know the investors, they’ll pitch for me .”

I understand the temptation . Fundraising can feel overwhelming, especially when you’ve never done it before. Also, early teams often have limited networks and few investor connections. But fundraising consultants are not the solution — and the results are almost always disappointing.

Success stories of startups backed by individual consultants or agencies are rare. In fact, I can’t name a single unicorn that used a consultant to raise their first check and went on to build something meaningful. Many of these consultants just offer deck design and messaging services. But at pre-seed and seed, what matters is your understanding of the market, traction, and product, not a tested deck structure.

What VCs see when a consultant reaches out

Outsourcing your fundraising is not a shortcut, it’s a signal to VCs, the wrong one. The overwhelming majority of investors, including me, avoid founders who use fundraising agents. Because what it really says is that you can’t build relationships, you’re not willing to learn, and you’re already making questionable capital allocation decisions.

Raising money is not something you outsource. It’s something you do yourself. You pitch. You get rejected. You make your story better. You learn what resonates. That’s how you get better at fundraising and talking to investors.

What to do instead of paying fundraising consultants

If you feel lost while raising your first round, that’s normal. But there are far better ways forward than hiring a consultant.

First, join acceleration programs . They are designed to guide early-stage founders through the fundraising process, step by step.

Second, there’s a wealth of open knowledge available today on pitching and fundraising:

Course: Y Combinator’s Startup School .

Third, instead of hiring consultants, look for angel investors . The best-case scenario is finding one who also becomes a mentor — not because they charge for advice, but because your success is now directly aligned with theirs. To find a great angel, look at their previous investments. If they’ve backed successful teams and are willing to support you, that’s a far stronger signal than any deck design service.

Fourth, if angels are hard to find, start with mentors . It doesn’t need to be formal. You can ask just anyone you admire — from founders and operators to VCs. If a founder who knows how to pitch their vision with clarity and conviction reached out to me and asked for help, I’d consider mentoring them. Some mentors will help for free. Others might ask for 0.1–1% of the company. Either way, it’s a worthwhile exchange, especially if they’ve been through the stage you’re at now.

Last but not least, reach out to experienced founders in your country or vertical . Often, the best mentors are just one or two rounds ahead of you. They still remember the grind, and many are glad to help — especially if you share a local or cultural connection. I often try to support founders from Ukraine for that reason: shared experience creates trust and motivation to help. You can also message YC alums or respected operators on LinkedIn. Many will reply because they’ve been in your shoes.

There are better ways.

More CEE founders are turning to fundraising “consultants” to raise capital on their behalf — a move that may seem efficient, but ultimately signals weak judgment, hurts investor trust, and rarely delivers results. There are better ways. Look for angel investors who will provide guidance and advice. Apply to acceleration programs and ask for mentorship from experienced operators. But most importantly: Pitch your own story . No one can believe in your company more than you. And that’s what we as early-stage investors are really investing in.",5200,NA,first-time founders | founders,"€10,000–30,000",seed,investors | VCs,low

Between 1985 and 2014, at least 137 countries experienced at least one declared state of emergency. Some follow clear and immediate crises — war, pandemics, natural disasters, with about 90% of constitutions worldwide including explicit provisions for states of emergency. Others arise from far more ambiguous threats.

“Emergency powers are meant to be temporary and targeted,” explains Ed Bogan , a former CIA officer with more than two decades of overseas experience . “But more and more, they’re being used to consolidate authority, suppress dissent, and weaken democratic accountability. The warning lights are blinking red right now.”

Bogan is the founder and board chair of the newly launched Institute for the Study of States of Exception (ISSE) , a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to tracking, analyzing, and exposing the misuse of emergency powers worldwide.

The concept of a “state of exception” refers to moments when normal legal protections are suspended in the name of crisis management. While such measures are embedded in constitutions across the globe, Bogan argues that the real danger lies not in their existence, but in their normalization.

When states of emergency become permanent

We met with Edward Bogan earlier this year in Kyiv, during the Invest in Bravery conference . Bogan is a retired CIA Operations Officer with 24 years of experience in national security and intelligence operations across South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. He served as a two-time Chief of Station and three-time Chief of Base, completing five of his seven PCS assignments in designated war and combat zones, as well as multiple acting leadership roles in countries experiencing active armed conflict.

Bogan’s interest in states of exception began at the intersection of philosophy and law. While studying constitutional structures and contemporary continental philosophy, he encountered the work of Italian thinker Giorgio Agamben, who warned that emergency measures, once exceptional, were becoming permanent features of modern governance.

“That idea stopped being abstract for me during COVID,” Bogan explains. “We saw roughly 180 states of emergency declared around the world, all with different contours. Some were handled responsibly. Others were weaponized.”

For Bogan, the pandemic merely accelerated a trend he had already witnessed during his career abroad. Serving in regions under immense political pressure, South Asia, North Africa, Eastern Europe, he saw how leaders made extraordinary decisions during moments of instability.

“Emergency powers aren’t inherently bad,” he says. “In fact, they’re necessary. The problem is what happens after. Too often, leaders don’t let go.”

How power stretches

Abuse of emergency authority tends to follow two patterns, Bogan explains. In some cases, a real crisis is stretched far beyond its original scope. In others, an emergency is manufactured altogether.

South Korea offers a recent example of the latter. In December of last year, the country’s president declared martial law amid corruption investigations involving himself and his wife. While the constitution allows for such a declaration, the legislature must immediately approve it. The president attempted to block that process. The legislature ultimately rejected the move, and courts later ruled it an abuse of emergency powers.

“That’s the system working,” Bogan says. “But not every country has those safeguards.”

El Salvador illustrates the opposite case. President Nayib Bukele’s state of emergency was declared in response to gang violence in March 2022 and has been extended repeatedly, while efforts to remove presidential term limits move forward .

“That’s how you work the system while you have power,” Bogan says. “You change the rules so you never have to give it back.”

Europe’s democratic stress test

The phenomenon is not limited to the Global South. In Europe, Bogan points to Hungary as a cautionary tale. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán used migration flows following the Arab Spring to declare a state of emergency, and has largely governed under it ever since.

“It’s not autocracy overnight,” Bogan says. “It happens gradually.”

Turkey follows a similar trajectory, he tells me. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan responded to genuine crises with emergency measures, then used them to restructure political institutions, reduce accountability, and ensure long-term control.

“This isn’t a light switch,” Bogan emphasizes. “Countries exist on a spectrum. What matters is whether they resolve emergencies and return to the rule of law, or slide further away from it.”

A systematic approach to executive power in crisis

There isn’t one single, perfect global dataset for “states of exception” (because countries define and publish emergencies differently), but there are several strong datasets. (For example, these include the ICNL COVID-19 Civic Freedom Tracker, the Lex-Atlas Emergency Powers Dataset, and academic datasets such as Bjørnskov et al.’s “Unconstitutional States of Emergency” dataset.)

That spectrum is exactly what ISSE aims to track; formally declared states of emergency, prolonged ones, and informally maintained emergency powers. The institute is built around three core pillars: monitoring, research, and public engagement. Its work will range from curating interdisciplinary scholarship and hosting conferences to drafting model laws and filing amicus briefs in key court cases.

One of ISSE’s flagship projects will be a country-by-country scorecard assessing how emergency powers are used, and abused, across jurisdictions. The institute also plans to release an annual “State of the World” report examining democratic resilience and executive overreach.

“We want a methodology that’s transparent, defensible, and comparable across time and geography,” Bogan says. “And we want people to actually look forward to these reports, like they do with the Freedom House Index, because they can feel something is wrong.”

The United States is not immune

ISSE’s launch comes amid growing debate over emergency powers in the United States. Bogan stresses that the institute was not created in response to any single administration. But the trend is unmistakable.

“Over the last four or five presidents, emergency powers have been used more frequently than ever,” he notes. “Partly because Congress is so dysfunctional.”

Recent Supreme Court rulings, including those invoking the “major questions doctrine”, signal growing judicial concern over executive overreach. Future decisions, particularly those involving national security and trade, may further define the limits of emergency authority.

“These are foundational questions,” Bogan says. “If we get this wrong, the system collapses. If we get it right, the system can bend without breaking.”

Ukraine: A necessary exception

Ukraine presents a different case. The country has been under martial law since Russia’s full-scale invasion, suspending elections and concentrating power in the executive. Bogan argues that the circumstances justify extraordinary measures.

“A country under occupation can’t make fully free choices,” he says. “That doesn’t mean everything is beyond scrutiny, but it does mean context matters.”

Beyond research, Bogan remains deeply involved in Ukraine through defense technology and strategic coordination . He frequently travels to the country, connecting companies, investors, and capabilities to strengthen Ukraine’s ability to defend itself.

“Early on, people said the war would be over in three days,” he recalls. “That was based on flawed assessments of Russian capabilities. Corruption hollowed out what looked powerful on paper.”

Building a global platform

ISSE is intentionally global in scope. Its team spans continents, and its work is designed to bring academics, lawyers, policymakers, journalists, and affected communities into conversation.

“This won’t work if it’s only theoretical,” Bogan says. “And it won’t work if it’s only practical. We need dialogue between people who study power and people who wield it.”

For now, much of the institute’s work is volunteer-driven. Bogan hopes that sustained fundraising will allow ISSE to support paid research positions, fellowships, and global conferences beginning in 2026.

“We’re building the plane while we’re flying it,” he says.

“But this issue is too urgent to wait. The question isn’t whether emergencies will happen. It’s whether we allow them to permanently redefine how power works, ” explains Bogan.",8602,NA,Ed Bogan | Edward Bogan,NA,NA,NA,low

The reality, as it turns out, is far more beige, and significantly more interesting.

A new report on reality of agencies in the age of AI , from Croatian platform Productive, surveying 180 agencies globally , reveals that the industry isn’t collapsing under the weight of automation .

We are witnessing a “quiet period of transition” where the hype is finally meeting the hard reality of the balance sheet . For agency leaders trying to navigate these murky waters, the data (as always) offers to be a lighthouse. If they don’t miss it, they could learn its prime time to stop defending their hours and start defending their value .

The “AI Discount” is coming for your inbox

The most immediate point of the report is, unsurprisingly, the bill. Clients have seen the headlines and are starting to ask the inevitable question: “ If a bot wrote this, why am I paying human prices ?” .

According to the report, 27% of agencies have already been asked for “AI discounts,” yet only 13% have actually lowered their rates . The smartest firms are “owning the narrative” before the client even brings it up . They aren’t explaining their tooling costs; they support their fees in expertise and outcomes .

Tomislav Car , CEO of Productive, suggests that the shift toward value-based pricing is the only way out of this trap. “ The conversation shifts from ‘How much does it cost to build a website?’ to ‘What is this redesign worth to your business? ’” Car says.

“ If the new website is expected to increase revenue, improve conversion, bring in more qualified leads, or shorten the sales cycle, that expected impact becomes the basis for pricing .”

However, transitioning to this model isn’t just a matter of changing the invoice template. Car identifies three major hurdles :

Agencies are still learning how to best define and quantify value with clients.

The clients themselves often don’t know what the impact is worth to them or they haven’t measured it.

The clients hesitate to communicate their budgets or targets to the agency, this is a matter of trust.

“That’s why value-based pricing is still the minority model , even though a lot of agencies have wanted to move in that direction for years, in order to improve their margins.”

The quiet profitability boom

While the media focused on the fear of AI-driven obsolescence, agencies were busy streamlining their operations. A staggering 65% of agencies report a positive impact on their revenue or profitability thanks to AI .

Interestingly, this isn’t coming from a flood of new AI-specific work. It’s coming from “ finding new and smarter ways to do the same work “ . Agencies are automating the administration stuff: reporting, meeting notes, and proposal drafting, and reinvesting that saved time back into the project to add more value .

The lesson here is simple: efficiency is for the agency to keep, not to pass back as a discount . The firms seeing the biggest margin improvements (nearly half of the successful ones) are those that kept their prices steady while using AI to cut internal production time .

The talent shuffle: Skills over headcount

For those fearing a mass layoff wave, the data offers some relief. Significant staff reductions due to AI are rare, affecting only 3% of surveyed agencies . Instead, we are seeing a “slow rewrite” of the agency org chart .

Agencies are becoming more cautious about new hires , testing how far they can stretch existing capacity before adding headcount . The result is the rise of the “Hybrid Role” — copywriters who are prompt masters and designers who act as AI curators . AI literacy is no longer a bonus skill .

New revenue streams

While most are using AI to save time, a smaller, more adventurous group (about 13%) has managed to turn AI experimentation into meaningful new revenue . Examples include:

AI Consultancy & Education : Helping clients understand the tech they are terrified of . GEO (Generic Engine Optimization) : A new take on SEO focused on visibility within AI search engines like Gemini and Perplexity . AI-Augmented Apps : Creating proprietary internal tools that they then license or use as a competitive moat .

GEO (Generic Engine Optimization) : A new take on SEO focused on visibility within AI search engines like Gemini and Perplexity .

AI-Augmented Apps : Creating proprietary internal tools that they then license or use as a competitive moat .

In any case, Car advises agencies to avoid the “shiny object” trap when looking for these new streams. “ Start with the problem, not the technology ,” he says. “ A much better question is ‘What problem do our clients need help solving that they couldn’t solve before AI?’ The agencies that are quick to figure this out will be much better positioned on tomorrow’s market. ”

Show me the value!

The “Agency of Tomorrow” looks remarkably like the agency of yesterday, just with better tools and a more honest relationship with value. The market is shifting from “how much time did this take?” to “what did this achieve?” .

To navigate this change, agencies must stop being passive observers of the AI hype . Use the efficiency to boost your margins, re-educate your clients on why they hire humans in the first place, and for heaven’s sake, stop billing by the hour . The machines are fast, but the strategy is still all you.",5588,Productive,Tomislav Car,NA,NA,NA,low

Several proposed EU “flagship” defense projects, including a counter-drone system previously described as a ‘drone wall’, appeared to lack firm political support ahead of a Brussels summit.

What first looked like a procedural oversight also reflected deeper divisions within the EU. As Reuters reported, the European Commission, which proposed the initiatives, sees defence as an area for greater EU involvement , while many national governments still regard it as a national responsibility, best handled through NATO or smaller coalitions.

For Europe’s tech ecosystem, the implications run deeper than institutional politics. At stake is whether one of the continent’s most advanced and sensitive technology stacks, AI-driven airspace defense, will emerge through coordinated European programmes or fragmented national efforts.

What the “drone wall” actually is

Officially renamed the European Drone Defense Initiative , it describes a distributed, software-centric airspace defense system designed to detect, track, and neutralise hostile unmanned aerial vehicles across Europe.

Technically, it is a layered architecture:

Distributed sensing : radar, RF detection, acoustic arrays, electro-optical and thermal cameras capable of spotting low-flying, low-signature drones. Sensor fusion and AI perception : machine-learning models aggregating signals into a coherent air picture . Command-and-control software : prioritising threats and proposing responses in real time. Countermeasures : from jamming and spoofing to low-cost interceptors and, in some cases, kinetic effectors. Interoperability : linking national militaries, border forces, and agencies such as Frontex .

Command-and-control software : prioritising threats and proposing responses in real time.

Countermeasures : from jamming and spoofing to low-cost interceptors and, in some cases, kinetic effectors.

Interoperability : linking national militaries, border forces, and agencies such as Frontex .

Crucially, this is not a single system but a system-of-systems , designed to scale across borders while remaining modular. That modularity is also what makes it politically contentious: it requires shared standards, shared data, and shared governance.

Why Europe is debating this now

On 10 September 2025, Poland reported that 19 objects suspected to be Russian drones entered its airspace during a Russian attack on Ukraine and some were shot down by Polish/NATO aircraft. This followed similar incidents in Romania, Denmark, and Germany.

Northern and eastern member states, Finland , Lithuania , and others, have been the most vocal backers of a pan-European approach. For them, drones are not a future risk but a present one, tied to hybrid warfare tactics already deployed by Russia.

At the same time, doubts about long-term US commitments to European security, sharpened during President Donald Trump ’s tenure, have pushed Brussels to explore greater strategic autonomy. The drone wall sits alongside three other proposed flagships — Eastern Flank Watch, a European Air Shield, and a European Space Shield , intended to prepare Europe for defense by 2030.

Industry perspective

For Europe’s defense-tech founders, the debate exposes a familiar problem: innovation speed versus institutional structure .

According to Bogdan Ochiană , Founder and CEO of Orbotix , the difference between Europe and Ukraine is not talent, but feedback loops . In Ukraine, operational necessity collapses procurement, testing, and deployment into a single continuous cycle. Systems are iterated in weeks because lives depend on it.

In the EU, the constraints are structural. Certification, safety, and accountability are essential, but they slow iteration.

“At the same time, Europe still lacks sufficient early-stage private capital and startup-oriented public grants that support rapid hardware and software development,” shared Ochiana.

Procurement also remains a key bottleneck. “ Startups must be able not only to build, but to manufacture and sell through processes that were largely designed for legacy contractors. The challenge is not to lower standards, but to modernize procurement so innovation, production, and adoption can move in parallel ,” he added.

Capability gaps

From an engineering standpoint, Europe faces two interconnected capability gaps, says Srdjan Kovačević , Founder and CEO of Orqa FPV. The first is unmanned capability at the tactical land-force level.

“ Armoured assault in the age of drones is as suicidal as a calvary charge was in the age of machine guns and tanks . NATO countries, especially the European allies, must urgently transform their land forces by ramping up their unmanned capabilities ,” shared Kovačević.

The second gap is air defense economics . “ NATO’s current systems aren’t able to provide sustained protection against low-cost unmanned aerial threats. Using a €100k missile to shoot down a €30k drone clearly isn’t sustainable. We need to re-think air defense and adapt it to a reality where massive air strikes are no longer the privilege of top tier powers ”, said Kovačević.

He explained that, in practical terms, the required transformation of land forces would mean integrating organic unmanned capabilities into every manoeuvre battalion across NATO armies. “ This “unmanned capability” can be further defined as attritable short- and medium-range reconnaissance drones, as well as low-cost precision strike drones. This type of organic unmanned capability is simple, effective, and can be achieved quickly and cheaply ,” he explained.

Ways to scale? AI and autonomy, a lesson from Ukraine

Ochiană frames AI not as a way to remove humans from decision-making, but as a way to make human control viable at modern threat scale. No operator can manually track and classify hundreds of fast-moving aerial objects in real time. AI must handle perception, prioritisation, and coordination, while humans retain command intent .

“ In practice, this shifts the operator’s role from piloting individual assets to supervising a system-of-systems. That shift is essential for any credible “drone wall” concept. Without AI-driven autonomy, airspace defense simply cannot scale. With it, Europe can build layered, interoperable, and resilient defenses that are effective, affordable, and fully aligned with democratic control ,” said Ochiană.

Kovačević adds the economic dimension . “ In a world where low-cost, mass unmanned strike capability is widely available, AI is critical for maintaining accurate real-time situational awareness and for orchestrating efficient counter-effect actions ,” he added.

Technically, this shifts operators from piloting individual assets to supervising systems-of-systems . Politically, it raises questions about trust, oversight, and accountability. But without this shift, any pan-European airspace defense remains theoretical. Ukraine provides the most immediate real-world validation of this model. Facing sustained, large-scale drone and missile attacks, Ukrainian forces have been forced to develop layered air-defense systems where AI-enabled detection, classification, and cueing compensate for limited human bandwidth and scarce interceptors.

During a speech in October, Ursula von der Leyen explicitly acknowledged this role, underlining Ukraine as a critical partner rather than just a beneficiary of European defense efforts. “ We need a system that is affordable and fit for purpose. For swift detection, swift interception, and when needed, swift neutralisation. And we have much to learn from Ukraine in this field. Both on capabilities, but even more importantly on their ecosystem of rapid innovation. And Ukraine is ready to support our efforts.”",8066,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,low

Yet, despite a steady flow of innovation, the region often struggles to turn technical brilliance into global market dominance. In February, the unlockit conference in Belgrade aims to change that narrative by focusing on the missing piece of the puzzle: the art of scaling .

Leading this charge is Tanja Kuzman , the Director of the Digital Serbia Initiative (DSI). Since taking the helm in late 2024, Kuzman has been observing a region at a crossroads. When asked to describe the current state of the regional tech scene in just two words, her answer is somewhat expected: “Underrated potential.”

Closing the knowledge gap about scaling

The challenge for CEE founders is rarely about the code; it is about the “go-to-market” expertise . According to Kuzman, the data shows that while progress is steady, the gap between CEE and more developed ecosystems isn’t closing fast enough.

“ The region has enormous technological potential, yet continues to lack the sales, marketing, and go-to-market expertise needed to win globally ,” Kuzman explains. She notes that many teams fall into the trap of building for local or regional markets first. This approach often leads to a mismatch with global customer expectations, creating a ceiling that is difficult to break through later.

The unlockit conference is designed as a curated platform to bridge this gap. Rather than focusing on theory, the event brings together individuals who have already navigated the journey from a local startup to a global exit.

Learning from proven experience

The speaker lineup for February is a deliberate selection of “operators”. It includes figures like Damir Sabol , whose app Photomath reached 500 million downloads before being acquired by Google, and Branko Milutinović , the CEO of Nordeus, a company that proved a global gaming giant could be built entirely from Belgrade.

There is also Nick Velkovski , CEO of HeyReach , one of Europe’s fastest-growing SaaS startups, who will share lessons from independently scaling the company to $10 million ARR. Mirko Novaković , CEO and founder of Dash0 , previously founder of Instana (acquired by IBM for $500 million) and codecentric , is also bringing extensive experience in building globally scalable products.

For Kuzman, bringing in leaders with millions of users and successful exits was essential. “ We set the bar high because we wanted to create real value for every person attending ,” she says. “ They can speak credibly about product-market fit, building and growing sales teams, fundraising, failures, and resilience — and not just in theory .”

By showcasing these success stories, DSI is attempting to set new benchmarks for regional ambition.

“It signals that global success is not only possible, it’s expected.”

The “Unlock Code” for global growth

When asked what the secret to success is for a CEE startup looking to scale , Kuzman identifies a specific “unlock code.” She sees the process revolving around three core pillars:

Building products with international customer expectations in mind, from the Day 0. Understanding the user’s problem inside and out. Hiring “A-game” individuals early in the process.

Building products with international customer expectations in mind, from the Day 0.

Understanding the user’s problem inside and out.

Hiring “A-game” individuals early in the process.

This focus on quality and global readiness is also what international investors are looking for.

Here it is important to mention the conference will host VC funds managing over €500 million in capital . Kuzman observes that while investment levels in the region are showing slight growth, investors are keen to see whether the region’s immense potential can be converted into multiple global success stories.

“What they really want is to spot early signals of global growth so they can make timely investments. From our perspective, it’s also crucial for startups to understand how investment criteria are evolving and why securing funding is becoming increasingly challenging.”

What to expect at unlockit

The unlockit conference is structured to be more than just a series of talks, although it will gather 800 participants and 100+ speakers. Expect a high-energy gathering for founders, investors, and corporate leaders, says Kuzman. Main event start on February 19th at Sava Center in Belgrade , featuring two tracks.

The Growth Track focuses on the mechanics of scaling and global expansion, while the Inspiration Track is designed for young innovators and students to see how ideas transform into global products.

On February 20th, the 2nd day, there will be a shift toward practical, action-oriented sessions. These workshops will cover specific strategies in Sales Excellence, Marketing Growth, Fundraising, and AI applications .

Registration is now open via www.unlockit.org , including access to free segments of the program.

Toward 2026 and beyond

As DSI looks toward 2026, Kuzman notes its mission remains the same: creating a “10x positive impact” on the digital ecosystem. Beyond the conference, the organization is working on reshaping education and accelerating the transfer of knowledge to help local startups become “soonicorns”.

“ In 2026, we will focus on accelerating the transfer of sales and marketing knowledge for global growth .”

For Belgrade, the “unlockit” conference is just the beginning of a larger effort to ensure that the region’s “underrated potential” finally gets the global recognition, and market share, it deserves.",5604,HeyReach,Tanja Kuzman | Damir Sabol | Branko Milutinović | Nick Velkovski,NA,NA,NA,low

Croatian-founded GlycanAge, a London-headquartered biotech with deep roots in Croatian research, wants to change that.

The company has raised $8.7 million (€7.4 million) in a targeted funding round to accelerate the clinical development of its technology and expand access to glycan testing for clinicians worldwide. The round was led by Fifth Quarter Ventures , with participation from Guinness Ventures, BrightCap Ventures, South Central Ventures, Impetus Capital, Vesna Deep Tech VC and Lightfield Equity, alongside existing investors including LaunchHub Ventures and Kadmos Capital.

From longevity to hospital diagnostics

GlycanAge is best known for its flagship biomarker, an “inflammaging” clock based on IgG glycosylation , which is already used by hundreds of preventive and longevity clinics worldwide. The test helps clinicians personalise lifestyle and therapeutic interventions and monitor patients’ responses over time.

But clinics are only the first step. “Our goal from the last round was to move toward diagnostics,” Nikolina Lauc explained. Last year, GlycanAge secured $4.2 million (€3.57 million) in seed funding led by LAUNCHub Ventures and Kadmos Capital.

“Now we’re at the point where we have our own instruments, our own reagents, and hospitals are beginning to use them. This round is about accelerating that transition and going down the regulatory path within hospital environments.”

In the US, GlycanAge’s assays operate through CLIA-certified laboratory pathways as laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), while in Europe the company is progressing through clinical validation under IVDR frameworks , without claiming IVDR certification.

A first hospital milestone

The most visible signal of that transition is GlycanAge’s first hospital deployment at St. Catherine Specialty Hospital in Zagreb , a regional player in personalised medicine and the first hospital in Europe to introduce whole-genome sequencing into routine patient care.

St. Catherine has now become the first hospital globally to integrate glycan-based biomarkers into routine cardiometabolic risk screening , using GlycanAge’s proprietary platform.

“Hospitals are conservative — and they should be,” said Professor Gordan Lauc , Co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer. “But we’ve now made the first big step. We’ve put our machine into a hospital, and together with clinicians we’re developing diagnostic applications that actually make sense in practice.”

Two additional public hospitals in Croatia are expected to follow in early 2026, with further deployments planned across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

“ There’s already a machine in a hospital in China ,” Lauc added. “By the end of next year, we expect to have our technology running in multiple hospitals, each with a slightly different clinical focus.”

Gordan Lauc – Dragan Primarac

Why medicine needs new biomarkers

Gordan Lauc emphasized that the key problem with medicine today is that it is still imprecise. “Most drugs don’t work for most people. Patients spend years getting diagnosed, years finding the right therapy, often with serious side effects, and we still don’t have good biomarkers for personalised medicine.”

Much of that, he argues, comes from an overreliance on genetics.

“Genes explain only a small fraction of disease risk,” Lauc said. “ Most chronic diseases are driven by lifestyle, environment, and how we live. For that, we need modifiable biomarkers, and glycans are probably the class of biomarkers that will dominate diagnostics in the next 50 years.”

Unlike DNA, glycan patterns change dynamically in response to inflammation, stress, metabolic health, and interventions, making them particularly suited to preventive and longitudinal care .

“Genomics gives you the blueprint,” Lauc said. “But health is not static. To truly personalise medicine, you need biological signals that change with time and capture how the body is responding.”

First clinical indications: heart disease and women’s health

GlycanAge is initially focusing on a limited number of clinical indications, starting with cardiovascular disease .

“You cannot do everything at once,” Lauc said. “Our first focus is preventing cardiovascular events, particularly secondary prevention.”

While reimbursement systems in many countries do not cover preventive testing in healthy individuals, preventing a second heart attack or stroke is a different matter.

“Once a patient has already had an event, preventing the next one is something healthcare systems will reimburse,” Lauc explained. “That makes secondary prevention the fastest route into hospitals.”

The second major focus area is female health , an area Lauc describes as systematically neglected.

“Medicine has been an all-boys club for decades,” he said. “Women are more biologically complex, especially because of hormonal cycles, so they’ve often been excluded from research. The result is misdiagnosis; women spending years being told they have depression or fibromyalgia, when the underlying issue is hormonal change.”

GlycanAge founders believe its biomarkers may help identify transitions such as perimenopause earlier and more accurately, offering clinicians an objective signal where few exist today.

Two decades in the making

Lauc began working on glycobiology more than 20 years ago, building what has become one of the world’s research hubs in the field. “For a long time, this was pure research,” he said. “ Glycans were like the dark matter of biology, hugely important, but technically very hard to measure.”

Fifteen years ago, that research led to the discovery of a glycan-based ageing clock, which eventually became GlycanAge’s first commercial product. But because ageing is not classified as a disease, its early applications remained largely outside regulated healthcare.

“Now the situation is changing,” said Nikolina Lauc , Co-founder and CEO of GlycanAge. “Hospitals are moving toward prevention, and we’re finally translating over €40 million worth of grant-funded research into clinical tools.”

Scaling globally, with Europe at the core

GlycanAge currently employs over 30 people , with the majority of R&D, including clinical development and software, based in Croatia . The company is headquartered in the UK , with commercial, finance, and marketing functions split between the UK and Bulgaria .

More than 60% of revenue already comes from the US , despite the company having no permanent staff there, something this funding round aims to change.

“Expanding our commercial presence in the US is a priority,” Nikolina Lauc said. “At the same time, Europe remains the core of our scientific and clinical development.”

Looking ahead, the company’s ambition is straightforward but ambitious.

“Our goal is to make glycan testing part of standard preventive diagnostics,” said Gordan Lauc. “Something that everyone over 30 can access through their healthcare provider, not as a futuristic concept, but as routine care.”",7148,GlycanAge,Nikolina Lauc,$8.7 million,NA,Fifth Quarter Ventures | Guinness Ventures | BrightCap Ventures | South Central Ventures | Impetus Capital | Vesna Deep Tech VC | Lightfield Equity | LaunchHub Ventures | Kadmos Capital | LAUNCHub Ventures,high

But as someone who’s been working with this market for quite a few years now, I’ve come to believe that technology alone is not enough to take Web3 into its next stage of maturity.

The real bottleneck of any business is leadership design: who builds the systems, who sets the norms, whose perspectives shape how we grow — these are also questions that we must ask and consider carefully.

I’ve seen cases where exclusivity in founder networks and uneven access to funding have held companies back from scaling when they were led by fellow women. And to my mind, those are symptoms of a leadership culture that lacks diversity of perspective. Web3 is a highly-innovative space, which is precisely why it needs leadership models that are collaborative and inclusive in nature.

In this piece, I would like to take a closer look at why, exactly, having more women in leading positions is a strategic advantage rather than simply an item box to be checked in the name of abstract “diversity.”

Technology can scale — leadership needs to be able to, as well

Across industries, there’s an ever-growing stockpile of evidence that companies with strong female presence in leadership tend to outperform those without it. To give just one of the more recent examples, Grant Thornton’s survey in 2025 found that greater diversity in the boardroom is likely to lead to better financial performance.

After interviewing over 14,000 organizations across 30+ countries, 17% of respondents felt that their company’s performance improved as a result of gender equality strategies. And on top of that, 20% also added that a greater female presence in senior leadership has made their firms more attractive to clients, partners, and investors.

In other words, having your boardrooms be more gender-balanced isn’t merely an ethical aim, it has a direct correlation to your efficiency as a business. These findings align with what I’ve observed throughout my own career, whether in media, mathematics, investment, or now as CEO of a global exchange .

I’ve often noticed that women tend to lead with a different set of instincts. Our strengths often lie in collaborative decision-making, deliberately building trust — both within our own teams and with outside parties and stakeholders — and thinking in long strategic arcs.

These traits align very well with the needs of decentralized markets, as their real-world adoption continues to grow. After all, Web3 is building what are essentially new financial rails and tools for the broader public to use. Trust, adaptability, inclusion and focus on communities have as much importance here as the quality of your code.

Building inclusive leadership

One of the biggest misconceptions about gender inclusion is that representation can just improve naturally over time. In reality, it very much needs intent and effort.

For example, in my own company, half of the management team is female — a rarity in crypto and in finance generally. This wasn’t really a result of a quota or a diversity campaign, but it did happen because we intentionally designed systems that allow entrance for women . They can grow, receive support and mentorship, and get clear pathways to leadership positions.

We broadened our recruitment channels beyond the traditional tech-finance loop. We built flexible career tracks that recognize different strengths. Most importantly, we gave women equal access to decision-making opportunities from day one.

All of that was a deliberate move. To reiterate, diversity isn’t achieved by itself simply because you announce it. It is achieved by engineering an environment where it can thrive naturally.

What Web3 could become with more women at the helm

Based on both my own personal experiences and the various stories I encountered over the years, I fully believe that Web3’s culture would grow better with more women helping shape it.

For one, it would be more trusted . Even now, despite all the progress it has achieved, this market still has a lingering stigma of being highly speculative. Women leaders are more likely to prioritize sustainability and ethical governance, which are essential qualities if Web3 wishes to achieve mainstream adoption. For a technology that aims to serve millions, if not billions, trust is non-negotiable.

At the same time, becoming more inclusive can have a direct impact on product design . It means that more builders with potentially good ideas gain visibility where previously they may have been overlooked. Introducing more women into leadership roles directly shapes who gets funded, who gets heard, and whose ideas stand a chance at becoming part of the global financial infrastructure in the new age.

Finally, there is a boost to Web3’s overall resilience to think about. Women tend to approach problem-solving with alternative thinking, which means they can point out potential blind spots in existing models and help improve them. And when a crisis situation takes place, whether technical in nature or due to a market shock, teams based on cooperative leadership that women favor have better chances to ride out the wave and recover faster.

All of these are real competitive advantages, and they further prove how greater female inclusion can lead to Web3 being more capable of delivering on its own ambitions.",5487,Web3,NA,NA,next stage of maturity,investors,medium

Speed, scale, and aggressive capital deployment have become the default ingredients for success. In healthcare, however, this same recipe often produces disappointing results. The sector moves to a different rhythm – one governed by clinical evidence, regulatory scrutiny, institutional inertia, and, above all, trust.

It is this mismatch between venture expectations and healthcare reality that underpins the strategy behind PurposeTech’s upcoming second fund, set to be formally announced in January 2026. Rather than forcing HealthTech companies into exponential growth patterns borrowed from the VC playbook, the fund is designed around a more sober assumption: in healthcare, defensible niches can be built, but rarely through exponential growth curves. Instead, value is created through paced, profitable growth that reflects fragmented markets and conservative adoption.

To reinforce that philosophy, PurposeTech has brought on board Professor Shafi Ahmed as Senior Partner for its second fund, joining General Partner Zdenek Fred Fous . Prof. Ahmed, an elite UK surgeon, globally recognized health futurist, and Nobel Prize nominee, brings decades of frontline medical experience to a fund explicitly seeking to rethink how early-stage HealthTech should be built and financed.

The two recently sat down for an in-depth podcast conversation , examining what is structurally broken in HealthTech investing and exploring what more functional alternatives could look like.

Lessons from the First Fund

Over the past two and half years, PurposeTech reviewed close to 3,000 early-stage companies across its core verticals in Central and Eastern Europe. Roughly eight percent of the ventures reviewed demonstrated strong domain expertise, credible teams, and genuine clinical and operational relevance. Even within this high-quality cohort, the ability to raise capital remained exceptionally rare.

According to Fous, the issue was not execution or mediocrity, but economics. Most of these companies addressed markets measured in tens or hundreds of millions of euros – commercially meaningful, but structurally incompatible with venture funds that require billion-euro outcomes to satisfy portfolio math. This helps explain why PurposeTech’s first fund, structured as a classic VC vehicle, invested in fewer than 0.5% of opportunities screened.

Fous argues that healthcare – defined by fragmentation, conservatism, and complex stakeholder dynamics – is poorly suited to high-velocity experimentation and aggressive scaling. When early-stage HealthTech companies are pushed into artificial hypergrowth, the more common outcomes are burnout and failure, not durable innovation or success.

Designing for Profitability

PurposeTech’s second fund is structured to work within these constraints rather than against them. Its thesis is to build a portfolio of niche, profitable HealthTech businesses that dominate specific niches instead of chasing unicorn valuations.

The fund will concentrate primarily on unregulated or lightly regulated segments, including preventive care, digital therapeutics, remote monitoring, and productivity tools for healthcare professionals. These areas allow for faster iteration without compromising patient safety or regulatory compliance.

Central to the strategy is an approach increasingly referred to as “seedstrapping”. Instead of multiple funding rounds, the company typically raises funding once – usually below one million euros – designed to carry it to break-even within two to three years. The emphasis shifts from perpetual fundraising to early revenue, disciplined cost structures, and tangible customer value.

The ambition is not to create decacorns in a decade, but to build durable companies that grow steadily, generate cash flow, and become indispensable within their chosen niche markets. From a financial perspective, the fund targets returns in the range of 20%+ p.a. (IRR), driven primarily by cash-flow generation rather than valuation multiple expansion.

A Clinical Perspective on Innovation

Prof. Ahmed’s involvement adds a critical dimension to this investment framework. With more than thirty years of surgical experience across the NHS and international health systems, he brings a practitioner’s skepticism to technology-driven healthcare narratives.

For Shafi, innovation must address real systemic pressures. He highlights three in particular: workforce shortages, the rising burden of chronic disease, and the unsustainable cost of hospital-centric care models. Technology, in his view, is valuable only insofar as it helps improve patient outcomes or redistribute care more efficiently.

One concept he frequently returns to is the “housepital” – the gradual migration of care from centralized institutions into homes and communities. Enabled by remote monitoring, AI-driven diagnostics, and wearable sensors, this shift has the potential to improve outcomes while reducing costs. Shafi describes the current moment as a rare convergence of technological capability, patient demand, and regulatory openness.

Yet he is equally clear that adoption – not invention – is the real bottleneck. Healthcare systems change slowly, and solutions that ignore incentives, workflows, and culture rarely scale.

Building for Adoption, Not Just Technology

PurposeTech’s second fund reflects this also operationally. Roughly ten percent of capital is earmarked for venture building and portfolio-level support, aimed at helping companies navigate regulatory complexity, stakeholder alignment, and change management. The objective is to increase the probability that technically sound solutions achieve real-world uptake.

Looking ahead, PurposeTech envisions its second vintage – PT Capital – as the foundation of a regional HealthTech platform focused on preventive care and healthspan extension. Rather than a loose collection of investments, the portfolio is intended to function as an interconnected ecosystem, sharing capabilities, insights, and infrastructure.

The formal announcement of the fund will follow in January 2026. For now, the message is clear: in healthcare, realism may be the most radical strategy of all.",6354,NA,Professor Shafi Ahmed | Zdenek Fred Fous,tens or hundreds of millions of euros,NA,PurposeTech,low

The round also saw participation from Vinci, naturalX Health Ventures, Fluent Ventures, Aternus, KAYA VC, and Inovo VC, alongside a debt component provided by mBank and Orbit Capital.

The funding extends Jutro Medical’s Series A to €36 million in total , with €12 million secured earlier in March , and will be used to scale its clinic rollup strategy in Poland and beyond, while further expanding the use of AI agents in day-to-day primary care operations.

Founded in 2020, Jutro Medical has evolved from a single tech-enabled clinic into a fully integrated primary care operator. The company now runs 20 clinics across Poland, serves around 120,000 patients, and reports an average patient rating of 4.94 out of 5 across more than 500,000 visits, alongside an NPS of 86.

“By running our own clinics on our own software, we’ve learned firsthand which tasks can be handled by AI,” said Adam Janczewski, founder and CEO of Jutro Medical. “Instead of hiring more staff, we now build AI agents that do the same work — freeing clinicians to practice medicine, not paperwork.”

Building the AI layer on proprietary infrastructure

Over its first four years, Jutro Medical focused on developing its own electronic health record (EHR) system and operational software, which now underpins every clinic in its network.

Today, Jutro’s AI agents support patient intake and assist with visit documentation, preparing context before appointments. Doctors remain fully responsible for clinical decisions, with AI use being opt-in and traditional appointments always available.

According to the company’s data, it is growing 270% year over year, and in the past month alone nearly 1,500 doctor visits were supported by AI.

“These agents already manage thousands of patient interactions every month,” Janczewski added. “That gives us confidence not just in the technology, but in its readiness for scale.”

Addressing Europe’s primary care bottleneck

Despite the demand, OECD and EU sources highlight underinvestment in primary care relative to other areas, with pressures from workforce and unmet needs.

“Primary care is undergoing significant structural change across Europe, with thousands of small GP practices approaching retirement each year,” said Jan Szumada, Investment Manager at Warsaw Equity Group.

“Jutro Medical is capitalising on this opportunity, nearly quadrupling its revenue year over year while keeping EBITDA around break-even, which is a rare combination in this market.”

According to Szumada, Jutro’s ability to combine operational discipline with AI-driven efficiency was key to WEG’s decision to lead the round. “They’re proving that the AI rollup strategy can work in healthcare, and at meaningful scale,” he said.

Scaling the AI rollup model

Jutro Medical positions itself as the first operator in Europe to apply an AI-powered rollup model to primary care at scale. The company acquires clinics and integrates them into a unified technological and operational platform, giving each location access to the same EHR, standardized workflows, and AI agents.

This year alone, Jutro has added nine clinics to its network and expects to complete around 20 acquisitions annually. The model is designed to ensure consistent quality of care while improving margins through shared infrastructure and automation.

The new capital will fund further acquisitions in Poland and support expansion into other European markets. With more than 100,000 small primary care practices across Europe, Jutro sees a significant opportunity to consolidate a fragmented sector and set a new standard for publicly funded care.

“For us, this is a strategically important investment in healthcare,” said Bartosz Drabikowski, CEO of Vinci. “What stood out was Jutro Medical’s mission to improve access to high-quality care, combined with the practical, real-world use of AI in everyday clinical operations.”

Drabikowski added that the company’s ability to already demonstrate tangible benefits, from reduced waiting times to more time for doctors to spend with patients, played a decisive role. “These solutions are implemented at scale and deliver clear value for both patients and clinicians. We’re pleased to support Adam and his team in the next stage of growth.”",4448,Jutro Medical,Adam Janczewski,€12 million,Series A,Warsaw Equity Group (WEG) | Vinci | naturalX Health Ventures | Fluent Ventures | Aternus | KAYA VC | Inovo VC | mBank | Orbit Capital,high

Dual-use complexity and the ethical burden of innovation in a world shaped by conflict are all real topics – yet accountability, compliance, and robust guardrails are non-negotiable in defense tech . Any credible investor or founder in this space accepts that. The pace of VC may pressure traditional processes – but that’s precisely what venture capital exists to do. Speed does not equal recklessness.

While the ethical questions raised by Elke Schwarz are important and deserve attention, the debate also needs context: practical insights about industrial capacity, decades of underinvestment, and the role private capital now plays in closing urgent capability gaps – gaps that governments can no longer address alone.

The ecosystem will separate shortcuts from standards

As in every industry, there will be players who look for shortcuts. And there will be those who choose to build with rigorous assessments, ethical boundaries, and a long-term view. The ecosystem will sort them. Serious teams already hold themselves to a higher standard.

That distinction matters, and it applies to founders and investors alike. In this sector, accountability is the starting point, not an afterthought . Responsible venture teams and established industrial partners already treat compliance, export controls, and sanction regimes as foundational – for instance, our close cooperation with the Czechoslovak Group helps ensure strict compliance and practical industrialisation pathways.

Nothing about the venture model changes this. Venture capital compresses timelines, as it should; but speed in this sector is less about impatience and more about overcoming a system that has long been defined by heavy bureaucracy and multi-year procurement cycles.

One of the article’s central points – the discomfort around dual-use innovation during wartime – is more complex than the piece suggests.

The uncomfortable truth is that war accelerates technology. It always has.

Jet engines, cybersecurity, satellite systems, radars, medical imaging, drones, and the modern internet all emerged or matured under the pressure of conflict. This doesn’t make those conflicts any less tragic; it simply reflects the reality that urgency compresses development cycles. Acknowledging this does not make innovation less legitimate or less necessary.

Building for the long term, beyond any single war

Similarly, most of what’s being built today – autonomy, advanced sensing, secure data infrastructure, cyber protection, next-gen manufacturing, robotics – will serve Europe long after the war ends. Any war.

Serious players don’t view these advancements purely through a defense lens; they see them as part of rebuilding Europe’s strategic industrial capabilities . These technologies are the backbone of what Europe will need to remain competitive, resilient, and strategically independent in the decades ahead.

And this connects to a broader issue that is often missing from the debate: Europe has spent two decades outsourcing much of its industrial and technological base.

Not only defense: manufacturing, materials, semiconductors, robotics – we have allowed critical capacity to migrate elsewhere. In today’s fragile geopolitical climate, we find ourselves dangerously dependent on others for technologies that underpin our security and our economies.

We cannot enter an AI- and autonomy-driven era without rebuilding these capabilities at home. That requires investment – significant, fast investment – and collaboration across public institutions, established industry, and the innovative capacity of startups. Defense tech is one part of a much wider industrial re-foundation that Europe urgently needs.

The €1.1 trillion reality behind today’s capability gaps

To understand why private capital is stepping into this sector, we should acknowledge an uncomfortable structural reality:

for more than twenty years, European countries have underinvested in the foundations of their own security.

If EU member states had consistently met even the minimum guideline of 2% of GDP in defense spending since 2006, Europe would have invested roughly €1.1 trillion more into its protection and resilience. That missing trillion did not just open a capability gap; it created a technological gap between the systems Europe has – and the systems Europe needs to operate safely and remain strategically autonomous in this world.

Europe faces a structural dependency problem – and reversing it requires investment at a scale and speed that public budgets alone cannot deliver.

That’s why the debate shouldn’t be framed as a moral binary between ‘public good’ and ‘private opportunism’. And defense tech is one part of that effort. It intersects with civil infrastructure, manufacturing competitiveness, digital security, energy resilience, and the capacity to build complex systems on European soil.

Responsibility and innovation are not mutually exclusive.

In our part of the ecosystem, serious actors are not putting ethics aside or chasing growth at any cost. We know what is at stake, and we are committed to doing this the right way – transparently, within the rules, and with respect for both the risks and the consequences.

Conversation is welcome – and necessary. But to be constructive, it must sit within the full context: the €1.1 trillion underinvestment, the accumulated industrial and technological debt, the reality of wartime acceleration, and the simple fact that Europe cannot rebuild its strategic capabilities without the involvement of both public and private actors.

This is not about profiting from conflict. It is about ensuring that Europe is not left exposed, dependent, and unprepared in a world that is changing faster than many expected.",5890,Czechoslovak Group,NA,NA,NA,Elke Schwarz,medium

However, as this year’s European Deep Tech Report states, Deep Tech is often misunderstood. It encompasses different fields (from medical and biotechnology to robotics and quantum), and focuses on applying scientific and engineering breakthroughs to products for the first time. Unlike traditional tech, deep tech startups also require more initial capital to build truly defensible intellectual property (IP) moats, and they typically face longer timelines before generating significant revenue.

No wonder deep tech startups face various challenges on their journey, and many of them need additional support. We can offer them a bit more visibility at least, so we picked out a few newer players from the region (majority not more than 5 years old), which are still in pre-seed/seed stage, that are showing great potential: in their technology, its aplication, and the team behind them.

Newly established funds in the Baltics, Poland, and Greece aim to close persistent funding gaps while supporting founders with capital, operational expertise, and impact-driven strategies.

A new €35M fund targets early-stage innovation in the Baltics and CEE

A group of startup financiers has launched Aneli Capital , a new €35 million fund backing early-stage startups in the Baltics, Poland and wider Central and Eastern Europe. The fund will focus on ICT, robotics, space, photonics and energy, aiming to help young companies scale and secure follow-on investment.

Despite rising visibility, CEE startups still grapple with limited funding and slower scaling compared to Western Europe. Aneli Capital says it will offer fast decisions and founder-friendly terms to bridge that gap. “We look beyond hype cycles and back companies with real products, paying customers and sound economics,” said partner and fund manager Daiva Rakauskaitė, CFA.

The leadership team also includes Nerijus Baliūnas, Jacek Blonski, and Sabina Sinicienė. The group previously managed Business Angel Fund II and helped establish Lithuania’s VC and business angel networks.

The fund plans around 20 investments in its first five years, with average tickets of €1.5 million across multiple tranches. More than half of the capital will be invested in Lithuania, with the remainder directed to Latvia, Estonia, Poland and other CEE markets. Aneli Capital aims to fund eight startups next year and exit several earlier-funded companies.

Cofounder VC launches a new €30M early growth-stage fund to back revenue-ready tech companies

Polish Cofounder VC has unveiled a new fund aimed at early growth-stage technology companies, continuing the investment activity of the CofounderZone team. The fund will target startups with proven market validation, recurring revenue and strong potential to scale, offering both capital and hands-on operational support. The fund has completed its first close at €12 million and is targeting a total of €30 million.

The fund is sector-agnostic but will lean toward business process digitization, sustainability and health tech. Eligible companies should generate €100–200k in monthly recurring revenue and be profitable or near break-even. Cofounder VC plans to invest €1–3 million in about eight companies and will leverage a network of 250+ business angels for sourcing and co-investment.

“Innovation matters only after market validation. We invest when companies show demand, repeatable sales and momentum,” said Dr. Tomasz Golinski, General Partner.

Fellow General Partner Michal Sioda added that Cofounder VC aims to fill a funding gap in Central and Eastern Europe, supporting strong companies often overlooked by international investors.

Athens’ IFP Fund launches with €25.4M to back high-impact startups

Athens-based Investing For Purpose AKES (IFP Fund) has officially launched with a €25.4 million first close, backed by the European Investment Fund under the EquiFund II programme. The new venture fund targets entrepreneurs building businesses with measurable environmental, social and educational impact.

Positioning itself with approach to impact-focused venture investing in Greece, the fund aspires to help make the country a hub for social entrepreneurship. It is managed by an international team active in the Greek and European innovation ecosystems, which has already completed 12 investments in nine Greek impact-driven companies totaling €4.5 million.

“The next wave of innovation will come from founders tackling urgent social and environmental challenges,” said co-founder Markos Komondouros, noting that the fund aims to support such companies in Greece and beyond in partnership with the EIF and other investors.",3915,NA,Daiva Rakauskaitė | Nerijus Baliūnas | Jacek Blonski | Sabina Sinicienė,€35 million,early-stage innovation,Aneli Capital | Business Angel Fund II | Cofounder VC,low

An afterthought added after direction, structure, and strategy are already in motion. For Slavena Tisheva , the logic is reversed. She approaches brand as an operating system, the invisible architecture that shapes how decisions are made, how uncertainty is absorbed, and how organizations align when no one is watching.

We spoke with Slavena after Wiser Technology recently announced its new brand positioning, united under the slogan We Have the Code® and built on The Code , an internal delivery model distilled from more than 1,000 AI and digital transformation projects delivered across Europe, the Middle East and the US. The announcement comes at a defining moment for the company, which in 2024 emerged from the merger of several organizations and is now formalizing a shared brand identity.

In a group built from multiple operating cultures, the brand could no longer function as a communication layer alone; it had to become the logic that aligns how decisions are made across the whole system.

As Chief Marketing Officer, Slavena led the process of transforming that internal complexity into a coherent internal and external narrative. In this exclusive interview with The Recursive, she reflects on how her background in psychology, sales, and change management shaped her view of the brand, and what “identity after the merger” actually requires in practice.

The Recursive: What parts of your journey shaped the way you think about building a global B2B brand like Wiser?

Slavena Tisheva: I’ve always been obsessed with the “human operating system”, how people make decisions, and how organizations behave as living systems.

My journey didn’t start in marketing; it started in International Management. A defining moment came early in my career at Morgan Stanley , where I watched a massive digital transformation unfold. I analyzed it not just as a process deployment, but as a study in leadership. That is where I learned that you have to architect the outcome . If you don’t design the system for the people who power it, the transformation collapses.

That idea was tested in 2019 when I joined Prime Holding as a Business Development Representative, a company that later became part of what is now Wiser Technology.

I walked into a company of brilliant engineers delivering world-class work, yet as a business, we were effectively silent. We lacked the tools, the structure, and the shared story to translate that engineering mastery into market value.

I realized I couldn’t succeed in that role unless I changed the system. So, I pivoted from selling to building. I launched a sales enablement initiative and personally wrote over 150 case studies just to decode exactly what our engineers were delivering.

That period reshaped my perspective on B2B sales. I learned that it is never just a technical process; it is a psychological one. Clients are navigating uncertainty, bias, and risk. In that context, brand isn’t marketing – it is the ultimate sales enablement tool. It is a scalable system that creates enough psychological safety for a client to say “Yes.”

When we merged to become Wiser, I recognized the same structural issue again, just at a larger scale. There was immense objective strength, but no unified identity that could hold it together. At that point, it was obvious that this couldn’t be solved through communication alone. We had to build a brand promise that would function as an operating system – aligning our culture internally so we could deliver certainty externally.

My work has always sat at the intersection of brand and psychology. And the consistent lesson has been the same: real transformation is cognitive before it is structural. That’s why I don’t see brand as decoration. I see it as the operating system of the company, the logic that governs decisions when no one is watching.

When the repositioning process started, what was the one idea you felt Wiser had to make clear to the market?

We had to start by being honest about the environment we were operating in. Post-merger branding is one of the hardest contexts you can navigate. Several companies come together with different histories, cultures, and operating models.

The broader tech market is inherently chaotic. There is no universal standard for excellence, and clients are under constant pressure. When they see a large merged organization, the default assumption is often execution capacity. They negotiate on speed and price, not on value. What we needed to make clear is that Wiser is not simply a scaled execution provider. It is a unified force that brings structure into complexity.

Internally, that capability already existed. We had teams operating as true strategic partners, not just order takers. But it lived in separate pockets. The task of the brand was to take that level of thinking and make it the standard across the entire organization.

Strategically, this meant moving up the value pyramid, from “doing the work” to truly “guiding the client.” But you cannot command that shift through a slogan.

So the repositioning is not about inventing a new company. It was about creating a shared internal and external language about excellence. It was a way of telling every person inside the group: we don’t just execute briefs; we challenge assumptions and solve real problems.

At the same time, this shift had to be visible externally. Wiser needed to move from being perceived as a collection of specialized vendors to being understood as one system that owns outcomes end-to-end.

“We Have Тhe Code” now sits at the centre of that brand identity. How do you explain what it actually means?

At its heart, it is a promise with two layers of meaning. On the literal level, it speaks to our craft. We have deep engineering mastery. We write the code.

But at the deeper level, it means we have a formula for navigating complexity. When we say “We Have the Code,” we are not talking about syntax. We are saying that we have a repeatable way of moving from chaos to an outcome. In an environment where uncertainty is the default, we are promising a system that creates predictability.

The Code model emerged through pattern recognition. We did not look for heroic moments. We analyzed hundreds of projects, not only our successes, but also our failures. We examined the situations where we struggled, where projects stalled, and where decisions became blocked.

Again and again, the same question surfaced: when something went wrong with a large enterprise client, was it really a technology problem? Or was it a problem of framing the wrong issue, aligning the wrong incentives, or working inside unresolved organizational tension?

Across industries from automotive to financial services, the obstacles were rarely about programming languages. They were about how large systems behave under pressure.

The Code is the distilled logic of those recurring patterns. It is a navigation system built from lived experience. It allows us to enter a complex organization and say: we recognize this structure, we have seen this dynamic before, and there is a way through it.

How did you build this positioning in practice? What were the defining tensions and choices along the way?

From the beginning, we treated this as a discovery process, not as an act of invention. We worked intensively with the board and the leadership to understand what truly differentiates us in practice, not in theory. Then we took our hypotheses to clients and tested them against reality.

The central tension was between “innovation” and “certainty.”

There is a strong gravitational pull in the tech industry toward visionary language: unlocking the future, limitless potential, transformation narratives. We explored those paths. They are attractive because they sound optimistic and familiar.

But when we confronted these concepts with the lived reality of our projects, a different truth emerged. Our clients were not coming to us to be inspired. They were coming to us because they were blocked. Because programs were stalling. Because internal systems were in conflict. Because they needed stability, not abstraction.

We made a very deliberate decision to step away from visionary positioning and to build the brand on certainty instead, on who we actually are when things work, and also when they don’t.

That was the real tension: aspiration versus authenticity. We chose to build the brand on how we truly operate under pressure, how we fail, how we recover, and what we learn in the process, not on an idealized version of ourselves.

That is also why We Have the Code resonates internally. It reflects lived behavior, not an external aspiration. If we had chosen “innovation” as the anchor, it would have remained a poster on a wall. Certainty, on the other hand, is something people experience in real projects.

How do you expect The Code to shape the way Wiser communicates, and what does success look like looking ahead to 2026?

Internally, The Code functions as a filtering mechanism. It gives teams a shared reference point for decision-making. Instead of subjective debates, people can ask structured questions: Are we solving the real problem? Are we creating momentum? Are we designing for long-term ownership?

In that sense, it turns culture into something operational. Not a set of values on paper, but a working toolkit for everyday decisions.

Externally, the impact is equally structural. It changes the axis of the conversation. Instead of negotiating primarily on price or speed, discussions move toward responsibility and outcome. It positions Wiser not only as a service provider but also as a partner that is prepared to take ownership of what happens next.

Looking ahead, success for me means that the line between brand and culture disappears completely. The Code becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It shapes hiring, performance reviews, and daily stand-ups without the marketing function having to translate it. And it shows up with the same clarity across every outward-facing channel, from sales and industry events to employer branding and social media.

Coming from a change-management background, success is an operating system that runs quietly in the background. People don’t consciously “use” it; they simply make better decisions through it.

When teams can confidently say no to work that violates the Code, and yes to the right challenges, because they know who they are as an organization, that is when identity after the merger becomes real.",10553,Wiser Technology,Slavena Tisheva,NA,NA,NA,low

Founders complain about dilution and loss of control. Commentators question whether VCs create real value or just inflate valuations. Aspiring entrepreneurs wonder if bootstrapping isn’t the more honest path after all.

I’ve heard these criticisms for years — as a founder, angel investor, LP, and now as a GP at Eleven Ventures. And while some concerns are valid, most stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of what venture capital is designed to do, and more importantly, what kind of companies it’s designed for .

So let me address the most common misconceptions directly, using what I’ve learned from 15+ years on every side of the venture table.

Judging rockets like bakeries

The core problem with most VC criticism is that people apply the wrong expectations to the wrong type of company.

A bakery and a rocket company don’t operate under the same rules. One optimizes for steady cash flow, local market share, and predictable growth. The other bets on breakthrough technology, massive scale, and winner-takes-most dynamics. You wouldn’t judge a bakery for failing to reach orbit – so why judge a rocket company for not turning a profit in year two?

Venture-backed startups are rocket companies . They’re built for exponential growth in markets where being second or third often means being irrelevant. That requires a different kind of fuel, a different risk tolerance, and a different definition of success.

When critics say “most VC-backed startups fail,” they’re right. But they’re missing the point. Venture capital doesn’t aim for a high batting average, it aims for asymmetric outcomes. And that’s not a flaw, it’s the entire design of the asset class .

How venture returns actually work

Let me break down the math, because this is where the confusion starts.

A typical VC fund invests in 20-30 companies over several years. Of those:

50-60% will fail or return less than the invested capital,

30-40% will return 1-3x the investment (modest successes),

5-10% will return 5-10x or more (the winners that carry the fund),

1-2% might return 20x, 50x, or even 100x (the outliers that define a generation).

This distribution aligns well with a notoriously famous saying: it is a feature, not a bug . Venture capital exists precisely because traditional financing models (banks, private equity, revenue-based lending) cannot support this kind of risk profile .

Banks need collateral and predictable repayment schedules. Private equity needs steady cash flows and near-term exits. Venture capital accepts that most bets will fail because the few that succeed can compensate for all the losses and still generate outsized returns.

If you’re building a company that can predictably grow 20-30% per year with strong unit economics from day one, you don’t need venture capital. You need a bank loan or a patient bootstrap strategy. But if you’re building something that requires years of R&D, network effects, or market education before it generates revenue — something that could be worth €500M or nothing — then venture capital might be your only option.

What good VCs actually do beyond writing checks

Here’s another misconception: that VCs are just passive capital providers who show up for board meetings and collect returns.

In reality, the best venture investors act as coaches, thought partners, and pressure-testers – especially during the hardest moments . They’ve seen dozens of companies navigate similar challenges. They know which patterns lead to breakthroughs and which lead to dead ends. And they’re incentivized to help, because their returns depend entirely on your success.

When we built Telerik , our early investors didn’t just provide capital — they challenged our assumptions, connected us to customers and talent, and helped us think through strategic pivots that ultimately shaped our acquisition by Progress in 2014. Now, as a GP at Eleven Ventures, I see the same dynamic play out with our portfolio companies. Founders approach us not just when they need money, but when they need clarity . Should we enter this new market? How do we structure our sales team? What’s the right time to raise our next round? These aren’t questions you ask your accountant or your lawyer. You ask someone who’s been through it before.

Many companies approach us even when they’re profitable, not because they need cash, but because they want this partnership. That tells you something important about what good venture capital actually provides .

Bootstrapping vs. VC: A strategic choice, not a moral one

Let me be clear: bootstrapping is not morally superior to raising venture capital. And raising VC is not a shortcut for lazy founders.

These are strategic choices that depend entirely on the type of company you’re building and the ambitions you have for it.

Bootstrapping works brilliantly when:

You’re building in a market with clear demand and fast payback periods

You want to retain full control and ownership

You’re optimizing for profitability and sustainable growth

You can reach scale without massive upfront investment

Venture capital makes sense when:

You’re building something that requires years of investment before product-market fit

Speed to market is existential

Network effects or winner-takes-most dynamics dominate your market

You need to build infrastructure, R&D, or a team before revenue materializes

Neither path is easier . Bootstrapped founders face constant resource constraints and slower growth. VC-backed founders face dilution, investor expectations, and the pressure to grow faster than might feel comfortable.The key is choosing the model that matches your ambition, your market, and your risk tolerance.

Why LPs invest in Venture Capital (and why it matters)

Here’s a question most critics don’t ask: if venture capital is so flawed, why do sophisticated institutional investors (pension funds, hedge funds, family offices) keep allocating billions to the asset class?

The answer is portfolio theory . LPs don’t invest in venture capital because it’s safe or predictable. They invest because it’s uncorrelated with other asset classes and offers asymmetric upside.

A diversified LP portfolio typically includes public equities, bonds, real estate, venture capital. Venture capital plays a specific role in this mix: it’s the high-risk, high-reward counterweight that can generate 3-5x fund returns over 10 years when done well. And because VC returns aren’t correlated with public markets, they provide diversification benefits that improve the overall risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio .

This is why venture capital exists as an asset class. Not because every fund succeeds (many don’t), but because the ones that do can generate returns that no other asset class can match.

What happens to ecosystems without early-stage risk capital

Beyond financial returns, venture capital plays a broader role that often gets overlooked: it enables innovation that wouldn’t happen otherwise.

Think about Payhawk, OfficeRnD, Dronamics, FindMeCure . These companies didn’t start with revenue. They started with bold ideas, technical risk, and long development cycles:

Payhawk needed years to build a financial infrastructure platform before it could scale.

Dronamics required massive R&D investment to develop cargo drones.

FindMeCure was solving a problem that had no obvious business model at first.

Without early-stage venture capital, these companies wouldn’t exist. And without them, our ecosystem would be poorer — not just financially, but in terms of ambition, talent development, and the signal we send to the next generation of founders.",7689,NA,Founders | founder,NA,NA,angel investor | LP | GP,low

A recent analysis of EU-27 ecosystems identified more than 8,500 spin-offs across the bloc; highly innovative, IP-rich companies built on academic research, yet still only about 8% of Europe’s high-growth startups.

In Germany, universities reported 2,927 start-ups in 2023 , and nearly 40% of them were directly based on scientific research or technology transfer.

To understand how these trends stack up against developments in Western Europe, we sat down with David Photien , Founding Partner at Germany’s SCE (Strascheg Center for Entrepreneurship) Freiraum Ventures. The firm is placing deliberate early bets on university spin-offs, and Photien shared his views on the potential within German universities, and what it might take to replicate similar success across the CEE region.

Betting on “Leeway”: The Freiraum thesis

“ Freiraum is a German word, and it literally means leeway, ” Photien explains. “ We want to give leeway to startups and early teams that are just starting their journey. ”

The fund is a spin-off from the Entrepreneurship Center at the University of Applied Sciences in Munich , one of three major universities in the city alongside TUM and LMU.

“ We originally come from a university ourselves, ” he says. “ We’re a spin-off from the entrepreneurship center of the University of Applied Sciences in Munich. ”

Launched in 2020, Freiraum Ventures focuses on pre-seed, university-linked startups, sector-agnostic , typically investing up to €200,000 as part of early rounds. “ We want to support early-stage teams that come from a university, in a best case, a university spin-off, or a team that has gone through a university incubator or accelerator. That’s something we really like to see in our teams, ” Photien explains.

Why university spin-offs?

When asked why he is betting so heavily on academic ventures, Photien points straight to the depth of expertise and networking that happens in universities. “ It’s great when teams come from a university, because in most cases they have worked on something before, ” he says.

“ Think about a PhD candidate who has researched a specific field for a couple of years — they’re real experts. In the best case, they see that what they have researched can potentially become a company, and they find the right co-founders. That’s our best-case scenario. ”

This mix is exactly the kind of edge spin-offs can have over “normal” startups. “ It combines something that comes out of academia and an educational institution, it’s a bit of a filter for us. And it can really disrupt markets, because it’s often very basic research that’s behind it. ”

But Photien is equally clear about the built-in risk:

“ At the same time, if it is too much of a research project and there’s no market or commercialization , then it can be challenging. That’s where the team comes in. We don’t invest because we love the technology. We invest because we want to see that this technology leads to money in the future and leads to monetization. ”

Germany vs. CEE: When Academia stays in the Lab

While Germany reports over a thousand research-based startups a year from higher education institutions, many CEE ecosystems are still trying to connect the lab to the market in a systematic way.

In places like Eastern Europe, university projects often stay academic: researchers publish papers and defend theses. But stop there. Photien sees entrepreneurship education as one of the key differences.

“ That is also the reason why entrepreneurship centers in universities are very important , ” he says. “ In our case, our entrepreneurship center supports students with a curriculum that already teaches entrepreneurship. ”

Students don’t just write business plans; they try to build things. Yet many of the ideas never see daylight.

“ At least the students learn what it means to think differently, not just about the product itself, but about how it can generate value for potential customers, ” he explains. Even if they never start a company, Photien argues, that mindset is valuable:

“ Having an entrepreneurial mindset is one of the key qualifications even big companies like Google or Siemens want to see in their talents. ”

How Freiraum Finds the spin-offs worth backing

Freiraum does not sit back and wait for decks to show up in their inbox. Their deal flow is built on tight relationships with university incubators and accelerators .

“ We are in touch with a lot of university incubators, because when you go through these incubator or accelerator programs, you’re already more serious than just being a researcher in a lab, ” Photien explains. “ You decide as a team to take the step and join a program for three or six months, that already shows you’re willing to go to the next level. ”

Instead of only attending demo days, Freiraum talks to the people who see the teams every week.

“ We talk to the coaches that run these programs. They see the teams over a certain period of time, not just on one demo day. We ask: tell us the teams that have performed really well in the last six months, and why. ”

The key signals he looks for? Learning speed and ability to pivot. “ If teams are able to pivot quickly and learn quickly within that period, then there’s a good chance they will also continue doing this, ” he says.

“ If it’s a team that has one idea and doesn’t listen to anybody, that might not be a good case. ”

Too early for VC? Why Freiraum plays at pre-seed

A German angel investor Martin Giese once told me that early-stage founders often make the mistake of going to venture capital too soon. Photien largely agrees, clarifying that the first rounds are mainly dominated by business angels, family and friends, or people with domain expertise.

“ We’re an exception because we invest very early in pre-seed, but we are organized like a venture capitalist while investing like a business angel, ” he adds.

That means structured processes, and a lot of pattern recognition. “ We have due diligence, an investment committee, more partners in the fund with different views on teams, and advisors. I see over 150 pitch decks every month. Business angels normally don’t have the time to look at that much deal flow. ”

Particularly for academic founders in Europe, Photien sees grants as the ideal first step. “ Grants are a great opportunity , especially in Europe , ” he says. “ They are like a Kickstarter: they give you runway—the leeway—to develop the product to the next step, where you are able to talk to a customer and say: look, I have this technology that is already a product, and now it can solve your problems. ”

Founders who can pivot

The biggest red flag? A lack of learning and pivot capability. “ I cannot underline strongly enough how important it is to pivot the company, ” he stresses. “ From the moment you start talking to a customer and get feedback like, ‘I like your product, but…’ — that ‘but’ is very important. That’s where you see if a company learns. ”

Not every customer request should dictate the roadmap , of course, but founders must be able to judge when it’s a signal and when it’s noise.

“ The startup has to decide: if this customer tells me they want a different solution, is this potentially a problem for many other customers? If the answer is yes, you have to pivot. If the answer is no, and it’s just a very special case, then you shouldn’t. ”

For a fund betting on university spin-offs, that ability to move from research logic to market logic, without losing the depth of the science, is the real differentiator .

“ Most companies will be completely different after two or three years, ” Photien says. “ So it has to be the right operators for the business who can actually do this transformation. ”",7804,Leeway,David Photien,"€200,000",pre-seed,Freiraum Ventures,high

It’s a simpler way to generate revenue, learn the market , and build connections before shifting focus to a product.

For 12 years, we ran service businesses as well, 3 companies with more than 100 people across 5 countries. Then we started building Toolza , a financial management platform. The transition turned out to be trickier than we expected . So we decided to collect our learnings to help other first-time product founders avoid potential pitfalls. Because running an agency and building a product are two very different things.

Wait for the right signal

Not every agency can and even should become a product company. The right timing is clear when you encounter a problem expensive enough that solving it could become a business in itself.

We knew it was time when we faced our own operational challenge: we needed custom financial workflows for our ERP system. We didn’t have that expertise in-house at that time, so we reached out to another agency for a quote. The estimate was $100,000. That number stopped us in our tracks, and we started wondering how many other businesses were facing the same expensive pain.

That realization became our signal to start the customer development process . We discovered that other businesses had spent two or three times more building similar systems, while existing solutions on the market were either too expensive or too complex. It became clear: we weren’t just solving our own problem – we could build a financial management tool that solved a widespread, costly pain point.

Your signal might be different . Pay attention to repetitive pains that keep draining time and money. When you’re solving the same costly issue for the tenth client, that’s probably your cue.

And, by the way, we rejected that $100,000 proposal and spent a year building our custom workflows (which was another signal).

The part nobody warns you about

Moving from a “client-first” agency to a product-first company requires the deepest cultural and personal change . In services, you win by being a hero, saying “yes” to every client request, working late hours, and customizing solutions until the client is happy. In product companies, you win by saying “no” and prioritizing.

We had to unlearn being the service hero . Our job shifted from solving a client’s immediate crisis to solving the industry’s shared, fundamental pain. We embraced the idea that the industry is the client – not John from Company X or Sarah from Company Y.

This helped us move past the pressure of trying to build a single perfect solution for one company and focus instead on crafting a product that works for a wide range of similar businesses.

Listen hard, but don’t hard-code

The transition phase is toughest when you still have demanding service clients generating cash flow while building a product. This is where many companies fail, getting stuck in a loop of constant client customization . We almost did too.

The approach that helped us was to generalize, not hard-code. We listened hard to clients : what hurt them, what confused them, and what slowed them down. We’d solve that pain first, then generalize it into a module, template, or integration so that the next 10 customers get it out of the box.

Shift your focus from being customer-centric to being outcome-centric . Say “yes” only if the request can scale. Translate client feedback into fundamental primitives (settings, templates, API endpoints). This way, you keep solving real problems while sticking to a clear, scalable product vision.

The timing mistake that can cost you months

There are many pitfalls on the road from being an outsourcing agency to becoming a product company, and we fell into a few of the biggest ones.

We started developing the core product and conducting customer development calls in parallel. The feedback loop was too fast , constantly changing our roadmap almost every week. Instead, try to make your processes isolated and iterative. Complete a thorough round of customer development, finalize your V1 vision and roadmap, then start coding.

Once interviews are done, analyze what you’ve learned, find the common themes in requests, assess their priority against the core vision, and learn to say “no” to anything that doesn’t fit the architectural future. If you try to meet too many unique requests, you can lose your main focus.

Your old reputation will follow you

For a long time, our previous clients and the market continued to see us as a service company. That sort of perception can slow down sales and customer feedback, simply because it takes time for people to move you from one box to another in their minds.

It took almost a year and a half of consistent communication to shift that image . You’ll need to repeat your message – in every call, deck, and channel – that you’re now building a product, not just offering services anymore.

What founders should actually do

If you’re running a successful agency today and dream of a SaaS product, don’t wait for a venture capitalist to validate you. You’ve already been validated not by one but by a few dozen of your paying clients.

Start by creating a clear picture of the efficient world you’re building. Share that vision openly with your network and conduct customer development sessions to see how it resonates with their fundamental concerns.

If your vision solves a critical, recurring problem and makes a standard process significantly more efficient, you already have your product idea. Taking action is the only thing that remains. The money and the clients will follow if you offer a solution that solves their problems more efficiently than any custom development.",5925,Omnisend,NA,"$100,000",NA,NA,medium

Historically, mobile and Wi-Fi services have had to use different parts of the radio spectrum – the wavelengths used for wireless technology – to avoid interference.

Ofcom’s proposals would make the UK the first country in Europe to commit to sharing radio spectrum frequencies – specifically the ‘upper 6 GHz band’ – between these two different technologies.

Ofcom’s approach would work by dividing up the upper 6 GHz band, with Wi-Fi prioritised in one part and mobile in the other, and technical conditions and controls attached.

It comes as the UK’s full-fibre rollout continues at speed, with broadband companies and businesses struggling to keep up with the demand for airwaves that can be used for Wi-Fi in a time where connectivity is crucial .

Mobile companies also face challenges, particularly in busy places like train stations or stadiums where large crowds of people are all using their phone.

“Sharing upper 6 GHz would be a win for businesses and homes across the country who want both better Wi-Fi and mobile networks that are fit for the future,” says David Willis, group director for spectrum at Ofcom.

“Our plans open the doors to further economic growth and investment, while supporting the delivery of crucial innovations like 6G in the future.”

In a boost for the economy, this new spectrum-sharing approach would provide a significant increase in capacity for both mobile and Wi-Fi services. This would support the broadband sector to provide advanced Wi-Fi to businesses, industry and homes.

It would also help mobile companies keep up with demand in busy locations and support data-hungry technologies like virtual reality and AI.

By helping both the mobile and broadband sectors to enhance their services and cope with the increase in traffic volumes, it is hoped the proposals could create further opportunities for innovation, growth and investment.",2083,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,low

The survey shows 47% of respondents now have a higher appetite for risk, compared with just 26% who say their appetite has fallen.

Confidence appeared to increase with company size, with 57% of businesses with over 500 employees saying they are more open to risk than last year.

Risk appetite varied sharply by sector too. Technology businesses are the most confident, with 58% reporting a higher appetite for risk, followed by HR companies at 57%. Only 31% of retail sector companies said they have a higher appetite for risk.

Despite improving sentiment, rising costs are the single biggest concern for UK businesses, cited by one third of respondents. Other challenges include digital transformation (14%), the perceived threat from AI (13%) and regulation and compliance (11%).

Challenges also differ markedly by sector. Digital transformation is a significant issue for healthcare businesses (71%), but far less so for media and marketing companies (12%). Rising costs are a particular concern in education (71%), manufacturing (44%) and technology (44%), while talent shortages are most acute in healthcare (40%).

“This research is what we like to see as investors – positive sentiment from UK business leaders with a renewed appetite for risk, especially amongst tech CEOs,” says Tom Wrenn, managing partner at ECI Partners.

“What is particularly striking is the number of management teams actively considering private equity as they look to expand internationally and navigate the shifting sands of GenAI. We see this from the founders and CEOs we speak with, who are looking for experience and expertise from their partner to navigate the growth opportunities ahead of them.”

Confidence is translating into ambition for many, with more than 81% of businesses considering international expansion as a growth driver in 2026, including 86% of large companies, 84% of medium-sized firms and 75% of smaller businesses.

Of those companies considering international expansion, private equity and venture capital are the most popular funding options, cited by 35% of respondents, ahead of government grants (26%) and bank finance (23%).

Cyberflashing is a term used to describe the act of someone sending a photo or video of their or someone else’s genitals to another person without their consent.

Now, platforms will be required to take proactive steps to prevent this content from appearing in the first place – not just react after the harm is done. Tech firms will face some of the strongest requirements under the Online Safety Act as cyberflashing becomes a priority offence.

Those that fail to comply could face fines of up to 10% of their qualifying worldwide revenue, or have their services blocked in the UK.

Taking action

One approach companies could take to tackle these images is by deploying automated systems that pre-emptively detect and hide the image, implementing moderation tools or stricter content policies.

Bumble was the first dating app to explicitly moderate cyberflashing to protect its members from seeing unwanted pictures.

The women-first dating app launched Private Detector, an AI-powered feature that automatically detects and blurs nudity in images sent within chats. It then alerts the recipient who can choose to view, block or report the image.

“Receiving unsolicited sexual images is a daily violation that disproportionately impacts women and undermines their sense of safety online,” says Elymae Cedeno, VP of trust and safety at Bumble .

“Strengthening the law to make cyberflashing a priority offence is an important step toward ensuring platforms proactively address this behaviour to better protect members.”

Ofcom will now consult on new codes of practice, setting out exactly what steps platforms must take to protect users from unsolicited sexual images.

The priority offence marks another step in the mission to make the online world safer – particularly for women and children, who are disproportionately targeted. One in three teenage girls in England has received unsolicited sexual images.

“For too long cyberflashing has been just another degrading abuse women and girls are expected to endure. We are changing this,” says Jess Phillips, minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls.

“By placing the responsibility on tech companies to block this vile content before users see it, we are preventing women and girls from being harmed in the first place.”",2496,Bumble,NA,NA,NA,NA,low

CFOs overwhelmingly (96%) expect to see a rise in investment in digital technology and assets by UK companies over the next five years. The survey also found that 77% expect an increase in productivity growth and business performance over the same period.

UK CFOs showed small signs of growing confidence at the end of 2025, with corporate risk appetite edging up from autumn lows. Some 15% of finance leaders said it was a good time to take greater risk onto their balance sheet, up from 12% in the previous quarter – although this remains well below the long-term average of 25%.

Business optimism also improved in Q4, recovering from the Q3 low and rising above levels seen a year earlier. While confidence remains below its long-run average, the upward movement points to a more positive outlook among finance leaders.

Capital expenditure has begun to gain momentum, with 17% of CFOs citing it as a strong priority – a two-and-a-half-year high and slightly above the long-term average.

“CFOs are significantly more positive about improving performance through deploying AI and remain upbeat about technology investment over the medium term,” says Richard Houston, senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte UK.

“We know technology was a big driver of US GDP in 2025 and we see real potential in the year ahead for AI to boost UK business performance and fuel growth. However, to realise the full value from AI, we must combine human skills with technology and upskill people so nobody is left behind.”

Perceptions of external uncertainty continued to ease. The proportion of UK CFOs rating uncertainty as high or very high fell to 38%, down from 41% in the previous quarter – marking the lowest level since Q3 2024.

Despite the improvement in sentiment, geopolitical risk remains the top concern for UK finance chiefs heading into 2026, followed by weak UK competitiveness and productivity. Concerns around energy prices and potential supply disruption complete the top three risks, although this risk has eased slightly compared with the previous quarter.",2335,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,low

London-based Wifinity delivers tailored connectivity solutions that traditional telecom operators lack the capability and service model to provide.

The business serves clients across diverse markets including defence, leisure, specialist accommodation, corporate and public sector and offshore. Founded in 2007, it now serves over a million unique devices each month.

LDC’s exit follows a successful four-year partnership with Wifinity, during which the business has become a leading independent connectivity provider, doubling revenue and increasing headcount by 46%.

With LDC’s support, Wifinity has driven growth by investing in its wireless network infrastructure, deepening relationships with existing clients, winning new customers across multiple sectors, and making two strategic acquisitions – offshore vessel connectivity specialist Vital WiFi and network connectivity provider Next Connex.

These acquisitions expanded Wifinity’s capabilities into new markets, including offshore energy platforms and commercial shipping, and strengthened its technical expertise in WAN, SD-WAN and infrastructure-as-a-service solutions.

“LDC’s strategic guidance and deep sector experience has been instrumental in our journey to becoming the UK’s leading independent connectivity provider in the end markets we serve,” says Costas Demetriou, CEO at Wifinity.

“Together, we’ve invested significantly in our infrastructure, launched into new markets and successfully integrated two businesses that have broadened our capabilities.”",1663,Wifinity,Costas Demetriou,NA,NA,LDC,medium
